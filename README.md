This repository contains the work for my thesis titled "**Is it complex? An Approach based on Feature Extraction and Machine Learning Models for Basicness Computation**" for the Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

## Project Overview

The framework developed in this project automatically classifies **word complexity** and categorizes concepts as *basic* or *advanced*, with the capability to generalize to previously unseen terms.

### Definition of Basic Terms

A term is generally considered basic if it is short, related to concrete concepts, easy to pronounce, and frequently used by the general population.

### Methodology

- Various **features** influencing word complexity were analyzed.
- **Machine learning** models were utilized to identify the most significant features.
- **Nouns** were assigned a basicness score extracted from **WordNet** (WN) to reflect their level of complexity.
- Integration of computational analysis with **human judgments** to improve the understanding of the key factors influencing word complexity.

### Exploration of Large Language Models

The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) were also explored, as these models may have already developed advanced abilities in analyzing word complexity. They can be personalized by designing **virtual characters** that perform effectively in tasks related to basicness evaluation and communication.
